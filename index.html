						<h3>Capstone Project</h3>

						<img src="./images/webdev.jpeg" class="p-3">

						<p>This project is based on building the portfolio website for myself and deploying it. The website is responsive for various devices. In building this project, we used various tools like HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. This project is done as a part of the <strong>Zuitt Coding Bootcamp</strong> which is one of its kind and it helped me build my web development portfolio.</p>

						<h3>Object Tracking & Detection Using Machine Learning</h3>

						<img src="./images/cars.jpeg" class="w-50 h-50 mb-2 p-3">

						<p>In this modern world, Demand for Machine Learning is becoming more and more. The project that we have worked uses Machine Learning and Computer Vision to keep track of the objects. These concepts are very much useful, espicially in the field of bio-engineering wherein these are used to track variations in the shape of the different parts of the body and detect the diseases and diagnose them. Also, they are used in non-invasive MRI Imaging. This is one of the most exciting fields of sciences. The research about this project is still going on.</p>

					<h3>Financial Modelling Bootcamp</h3>

					<img src="./images/stock.jpeg" class="p-3">

					<p>This bootcamp is attended by the Finance Club of IIT Bombay during winter break. This is a one month long bootcamp wherein we were taught about various topics in Finance like future-and-options trading, algorithmic trading. Also, we learnt about how to read the financial statements and also the reports of a company. A detailed study on stocks of a company for about 10 years is studied and a final detailed report is made. We also made 3-statement model and DCF model using data on the internet for many companies. Also, an additional learning outcome of this bootcamp is the Advanced Excel.</p>
